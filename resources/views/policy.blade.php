                        <br>A non-refundable fee of $25 per family is required yearly at the time of
                        registration. We do offer a Pre-Registration promotion for all current students
                        which waives the $25 registration fee for the upcoming fall season. This
                        promotion comes out for a limited time around April and gives you many benefits
                        such as 1st choice of classes and early recital ticket option.
                        <br>&#9830;  <span class="design-1" style="line-height: 1;">Tuition</span>
                        <br>Is to be paid the 1st of each month. May and June tuition is paid together to
                        finish of the season. If you are enrolled in "Auto Pay" and would like to pay a
                        different way such as, cash or check, then tuition needs to be paid at the end of
                        each month. Otherwise the credit card on file will be automatically run on the 1st.
                        Tuition is divided into 10 equal installments. You must pay the first month's
                        tuition plus the registration fee on the day of registration. Tuition will be
                        considered late after the 7th and a $10.00 late fee will be automatically applied. If
                        tuition is not paid before the 1st of the next month, your child will be refused
                        admission to class. As each month allows for 3, 4, or 5 lessons, tuition will
                        remain the same each month. We operate on a 10-month season, September
                        thru June. May and June tuition is due together on May 1st. If a family chooses
                        not to pay May and June together they will not be able to participate in our
                        annual recital. Make up classes are available to any child that has an absence.
                        Tuition is non transferrable. Costume fees, competition fees, recital tickets, and
                        all fees associated with dance are non-refundable.
                        <br>&#9830;  <span class="design-1" style="line-height: 1;">Payments</span>
                        <br>Everyone must have a current credit card on file. KP Dance Center accepts
                        payments by check, cash and credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Discover)
                        <br>&#9830;  <span class="design-1" style="line-height: 1;">Full Yearly Payment</span>
                        <br>There will be a 5% discount given to any account paid in full for September-
                        June.
                        <br>&#9830;  <span class="design-1" style="line-height: 1;">Automatic Debit</span>
                        <br>We offer an automatic debit payment plan. If it is difficult for you to physically
                        come in to pay your tuition, this might be your best option. No hassles, no
                        worries.

                        This takes away from the scheduled classes. Under no circumstance should a
                        parent walk into a dance class room before, during or after a dance class.

                        control such as power outages, pandemics or other situations, the students are
                        encouraged to do make up classes (any style is ok) of the same age. No refunds
                        for lessons missed due to these reasons will be given.
                        <br>&#9830;  <span class="design-1" style="line-height: 1;">Substitutions</span>
                        <br>The school reserves the right to provide a substitute teacher if the regularly

                        and the school cannot arrange a substitute, students can do a make-up class of
                        their choice.
